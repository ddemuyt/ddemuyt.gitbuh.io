    12 Days of Grizmas, an annual event hosted by Griz, is intended to generate attention and revenue for non-profits. During the twelve days leading up to his annual 2-day festival in Detroit called GRiZMAS, all proceeds generated from events are donated to a variety of charities, and fans are often rewarded for their participation.</p>
